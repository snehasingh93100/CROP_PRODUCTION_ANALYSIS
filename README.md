# 🌾 Crop Production Analysis

### 📊 Overview
This project analyzes crop production data to uncover patterns in yield, area, and productivity across different states and years in India. The goal is to identify trends and suggest data-driven insights for agricultural improvement.

---

### 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze total crop production by state and year  
- Visualize seasonal and crop-type variations  
- Identify top-performing states for major crops  
- Correlate rainfall and production (optional advanced step)

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization  
- **NumPy** – numerical analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – IDE

✅ Copy everything above → paste it into your `README.md` in VS Code → save → push to GitHub.  
If you want, I can also make your **starter Python notebook (`data_analysis.ipynb`)** next — would you like me to generate that too?
